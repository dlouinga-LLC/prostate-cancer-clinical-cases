## Investigations & Results
### PSA Trends
| Date       | Age | Total PSA (ng/mL) | Free PSA (ng/mL) | Free/Total Ratio |
|------------|-----|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 2024‑01‑15 | 65  | 4.2               | 0.8              | 0.19             |
| 2024‑07‑20 | 65  | 4.8               | 0.9              | 0.19             |

**Calculated Metrics:**
- **PSA Velocity:** (4.8 – 4.2) ng/mL ÷ 0.5 years = **1.2 ng/mL/year** (>0.75 ng/mL/year is considered clinically significant).
- **PSA Density:** 4.8 ng/mL ÷ 30 g = **0.16 ng/mL/g** (normal <0.15 ng/mL/g).

### Imaging
- **Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS):** Prostate volume 32 cc, no hypoechoic lesions.
- **Multiparametric MRI (optional):** Not performed initially.

### Biopsy (if performed)
*Not yet done.*  

## Differential Diagnosis
1. **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)** – Most common cause of mild PSA elevation in this age group.
2. **Prostatitis** – Asymptomatic chronic prostatitis can raise PSA.
3. **Prostate Adenocarcinoma** – Must be ruled out given rising PSA, positive family history, and elevated PSA density.
4. **High‑Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (HGPIN)** or **Atypical Small Acinar Proliferation (ASAP)** – Possible incidental findings on biopsy.

## Learning Objectives
1. Interpret PSA velocity and density and understand their clinical significance in risk stratification.
2. Discuss the risks and benefits of a prostate biopsy with a patient, including procedural complications and the potential for overdiagnosis.
3. Address the controversy surrounding PSA screening, comparing current guideline recommendations and incorporating shared decision‑making.

## Discussion

### 1. Interpretation of PSA Velocity and Density
- **PSA velocity** of 1.2 ng/mL/year exceeds the commonly used threshold of 0.75 ng/mL/year, which increases the suspicion for prostate cancer and strengthens the argument for biopsy.
- **PSA density** of 0.16 ng/mL/g is borderline elevated (normal <0.15). When combined with an elevated velocity, it further raises the pre‑test probability of cancer.
- These metrics help differentiate cancer‑related PSA rises from BPH‑related increases, especially in men with prostate volumes >30 g.

### 2. Risks and Benefits of Prostate Biopsy
**Benefits:**
- Definitive histologic diagnosis.
- Gleason grading provides prognostic information.
- Guides management decisions (active surveillance, curative treatment, etc.).

**Risks:**
- **Infection:** Sepsis occurs in 1–3% of patients despite antibiotic prophylaxis.
- **Bleeding:** Hematuria (common), hematospermia, rectal bleeding.
- **Pain/Discomfort:** Periprocedural pain requiring analgesia.
- **Overdiagnosis:** Detection of indolent cancers that would never cause morbidity or mortality, leading to unnecessary treatment and associated side effects.

**Shared Decision‑Making:** The patient should be informed of these risks and the possibility that a negative biopsy does not completely rule out cancer (false‑negative rate ~15–20%).

### 3. Controversy Around PSA Screening
- **USPSTF (2023)** recommends individualized decision‑making for men aged 55–69 (Grade C), and against screening for men ≥70 (Grade D).
- **AUA (2023)** advises shared decision‑making for men 55–69 years, with screening intervals of 2–4 years. Does not recommend routine screening for men <40, >70, or with life expectancy <10–15 years.
- **NCCN** recommends baseline PSA at age 45 for high‑risk men (African‑American, family history) and at age 50 for average‑risk men, with subsequent testing based on PSA level and risk factors.

**Key Points for Counseling:**
- PSA screening reduces prostate‑cancer‑specific mortality but leads to overdiagnosis and overtreatment.
- The number needed to screen to prevent one prostate‑cancer death is approximately 1,000 men over 10 years.
- Patients should understand that an elevated PSA does not equal cancer, and a normal PSA does not guarantee absence of cancer.

### 4. Treatment Options and Comparison of Side‑Effect Profiles
If a biopsy were to reveal **Gleason 3+3=6 adenocarcinoma**, management options would include:

| Option               | Key Benefits                                   | Long‑Term Side Effects                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Active Surveillance** | Avoids treatment‑related morbidity in low‑risk disease. | Anxiety of living with cancer, risk of disease progression (≈30% over 10 years).       |
| **Radical Prostatectomy** | Curative for localized disease, provides precise staging. | **Urinary incontinence:** 5–20% (severe incontinence 1–5%).<br>**Erectile dysfunction:** 40–80% (depending on nerve‑sparing).<br>**Bowel toxicity:** Minimal. |
| **Radiation Therapy**   | Non‑invasive, preserves anatomy.               | **Urinary incontinence:** Rare (<5%).<br>**Erectile dysfunction:** 30–60% (develops gradually over 1–2 years).<br>**Bowel toxicity:** Proctitis (5–10%), rectal bleeding, diarrhea. |
| **Hormone Therapy**    | Used adjunctively with radiation for higher‑risk disease. | Hot flashes, loss of libido, fatigue, osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular risk. |

**Shared Decision‑Making Considerations:**  
- For low‑risk disease (Gleason 3+3, PSA <10, clinical stage T1c), active surveillance is the recommended first‑line approach.
- Patient preferences regarding side effects (e.g., prioritizing continence vs. erectile function), age, life expectancy, and comorbidities should guide the choice between surgery and radiation if treatment is desired.
