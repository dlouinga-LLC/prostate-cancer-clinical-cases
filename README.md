# Prostate Cancer Clinical Cases Repository

## Purpose
This repository serves as an educational resource for medical students, residents, and other healthcare professionals. It contains a series of hypothetical clinical case studies focusing on the nuances of prostate cancer diagnosis, the role of PSA testing, and the decision-making process for various treatment modalities. The goal is to provide a structured, peer-reviewed collection of cases that illustrate key clinical concepts and controversies in prostate cancer management.

## Intended Audience
- Medical students (clerkship and pre-clerkship)
- Urology and family medicine residents
- Practicing clinicians seeking continuing medical education
- Medical educators looking for teaching materials

## Standardized Case Study Structure
Each case study should follow a consistent template to ensure clarity and ease of use. The following sections are required:

1. **Case Title** – A descriptive title (e.g., "65‑year‑old male with elevated PSA").
2. **Patient Demographics** – Age, sex, relevant past medical history, family history, and social history.
3. **Presenting Complaint & History** – Chief complaint, duration, associated symptoms, and relevant review of systems.
4. **Physical Examination Findings** – Focused genitourinary and general examination findings.
5. **Investigations & Results** – PSA values (total, free, density, velocity), imaging reports, biopsy results (Gleason score, number of cores involved), and other relevant lab data.
6. **Differential Diagnosis** – Brief list of possible diagnoses.
7. **Learning Objectives** – 3–5 specific educational goals for the case.
8. **Discussion** – A structured discussion covering:
   - Interpretation of PSA metrics (velocity, density) and their clinical significance.
   - Risks and benefits of prostate biopsy.
   - Controversies surrounding PSA screening.
   - Overview of treatment options (active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, etc.) with comparison of side‑effect profiles.
   - Shared‑decision‑making considerations.
9. **References** – Key guidelines (NCCN, AUA, EAU) and landmark studies.
10. **Author & Reviewers** – Names/initials of contributors and peer reviewers.

## How to Contribute
1. **Propose a new case** by opening an issue using the "Case Study Proposal" template (see `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/case-study-proposal.md`).
2. **Develop the case** in a dedicated branch following the naming convention `case-study-XX-brief-title`.
3. **Submit a pull request** for peer review.
4. **Address review comments** and iterate until the case is approved.
5. **Merge** the finalized case into the `main` branch.

## Repository Organization
- `cases/` – Each case resides in its own subfolder numbered sequentially (e.g., `01-elevated-psa/`).
- `templates/` – Contains the markdown template for new cases.
- `resources/` – Additional educational materials (guideline summaries, flowcharts, etc.).
- `.github/` – Issue and pull‑request templates, workflow files.
